Python Installation and Understanding Packages
==============================================

Installing the Python language itself on most platforms is generally very easy.
However, installing the other core packages that you will need in day to day
work can be more of a challenge.  In addition the basic mechanics behind
package management can be confusing at first sight.

Workshop goals:

- Install Python and all packages needed for the rest of the workshops
- Understand the concept of Python modules and packages
- Learn how to find and install other 3rd party packages:
  
  - PyPI
  - using pip install
  - using python setup.py install

- Know where Python files live
- Learn how to solve installation problems
- Understand the issues involved with multiple Python installations
